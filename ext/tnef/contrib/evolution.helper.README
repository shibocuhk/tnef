Mark-
   We (The City of Largo) has implemented your tnef library in
Evolution as a helper application to open those pesky/dumb/stupid
winmail.dat
files that we get all the time.
I thought possibly, that you might want to include this little and
simple script in with the build as an example of how to deploy from
within Evolution.  It assumes they have gxmessage, but any graphical
front end utility would work.

Dave Richards

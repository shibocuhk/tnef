For bug reports or feature requests please visit the GitHub page
https://github.com/verdammelt/tnef and create an issue.

When submitting a bug report please always inculude:

* the version of tnef you are using: tnef --version

* the output of running tnef in full deubg mode (with both --debug and
  --verbose switches) against the data file).

* the data file causing the problem (if you can include it).

If you cannot include the data file due to privacy concerns please
consider making a test data file which produces the same error without
any private data, or sending the data file to the maintainer: Mark
Simpson <verdammelt@gmail.com>. Without a data file it can be hard or
impossible to debug and fix a problem.

                                   ====

TNEF is a program for unpacking MIME attachments of type
"application/ms-tnef". This is a Microsoft only attachment.

Due to the proliferation of Microsoft Outlook and Exchange mail servers,
more and more mail is encapsulated into this format.

The TNEF program allows one to unapck the attachments which were
encapsulated into teh TNEF attachment.  Thus alleviating the need to use
Microsoft Outlook to view the attachment.

TNEF is mainly testsed and used on GNU/Linux and CYGWIN systems.  It
'should' work on other UNIX and UNIX-like systems.

See the file COPYING for copyright and warranty information.

See the file INSTALL for instructions on installing TNEF.  The short form
for installation is the standard: 

    tar xzvf tnef-x.y.tar.gz
    cd tnef-x.y
    ./configure 
    make
    make install
